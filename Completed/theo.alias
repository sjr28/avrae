Now and as an action on each of his turns for the next ten minutes, he can teleport any number of creatures he can see within the area of effect to different unoccupied spaces he can see within the area of effect. An unwilling creature can attempt a Charisma saving throw to prevent this movement.\n\nAdditionally, if a creature he can see within the area of effect casts a spell or uses a feature that would magically teleport it to a different location, such as a dimension door spell or a conjuration wizardâ€™s Benign Transposition feature, he can use his reaction to force that creature to attempt a Charisma saving throw, preventing the movement on a failure."

When the target attempts to take its action on each of its turns, it must offer Theo an alternative action that it is able to take that cannot be the same type of action as the first (Attack action, cast a spell, Dodge action, etc.). Theo selects which action the creature must take between the two options presented. The creature need not tell Theo what it will do with these actions or how they work, only that it wishes to take them.\n\nAt the end of each of its turns, the creature may attempt a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect. If the creature succeeds on **two** Wisdom saving throws in this manner, the spell ends."
